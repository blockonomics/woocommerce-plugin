Accept bitcoin payments and altcoins on your WooCommerce website. Bitcoin payments go directly to your wallet. 

## Description ## 

The fastest and easiest way to start accepting Bitcoin payments on your WooCommerce online store. Since 2015, [Blockonomics](https://www.blockonomics.co/merchants?utm_source=wordpress) has helped thousands of ecommerce sites increase sales by including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as payment options for their customers. 

### A truly decentralized bitcoin payment processor for WordPress ### 

Blockonomics is the only Bitcoin payment gateway that enables full decentralization in the e-commerce industry. Purchases made to your website are instantly sent to your wallet, rather than to a payment gateway wallet. This not only saves you fees when taking your coins out, but it allows you to take ownership of your revenue without the need for a middle man. We have a long term association with [Wordpress and Wordcamps](https://insights.blockonomics.co/blockonomics-loves-wordcamps/).
