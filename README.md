### A truly decentralized bitcoin payment processor for WordPress ### 

Blockonomics is the only Bitcoin payment gateway that enables full decentralization in the e-commerce industry. Purchases made to your website are instantly sent to your wallet, rather than to a payment gateway wallet. This not only saves you fees when taking your coins out, but it allows you to take ownership of your revenue without the need for a middle man. We have a long term association with [Wordpress and Wordcamps](https://insights.blockonomics.co/blockonomics-loves-wordcamps/).
